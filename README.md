# Introduction 
Studies have shown that only 40% of US citizens own life insurance, millennials account for only 1 out of 5 of the 40%. Getting life insurance is a long and tiring process which requires customers to take numerous medical exams that can take up to 30 days. The process turns people off especially in this one-click shopping world with on-demand everything. This study will be using machine learning to accurately predict risk classifications of customers, thereby making the process of owning life insurance shorter and less labor intensive while maintaining the customers privacy boundaries.
# Data
The dataset chosen to be analyzed is called “Life insurance assessment” which consists of information about life insurance applicants. It was compiled by Prudential, one of the largest issuers of life insurance in the USA, for a study on how to accurately classify risk using a more automated approach. This data was obtained from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
